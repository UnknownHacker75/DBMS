1.Create a table which has the following fieldsCustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address,City, PostalCode,
Country.
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER(CustomerID number, CustomerName varchar2(15), ContactName varchar2(15),
Address varchar2(15), City varchar2(15), PostalCode number);
2.Write a SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:
 SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico';
 SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID=1;
3. Execute the following query that uses the COUNT(expression) function to calculates the total number of employees
name available in the table:
 mysql> SELECT COUNT(emp_name) FROM employees;
4. Execute the following statement that returns all rows from the employee table and WHERE clause specifies the rows
whose value in the column emp_age is greater than 32:
 mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE emp_age>32;
5. This statement uses the COUNT(distinct expression) function that counts the Non-Null and distinct rows in the column
emp_age:
 mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT emp_age) FROM employees;
 6. We can also use the count() function with the GROUP BY clause that returns the count of the element in each group.
For example, the following statement returns the number of employee in each city:
 mysql> SELECT emp_name, city, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY city;
 7. Execute the following statement that gives the employee name who has at least two age same and sorts them based on
the count result
 mysql> SELECT emp_name, emp_age, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY emp_age HAVING
COUNT(*)>=2 ORDER BY COUNT(*);
8. Execute the following query that calculates the total number of working hours of all employees in the table:
 mysql> SELECT SUM(working_hours) AS "Total working hours" FROM employees;
9. Execute the following query to calculate the total working hours of employees whose working_hours >= 12.
 mysql> SELECT SUM(working_hours) AS "Total working hours" FROM employees WHERE
working_hours>=12;
10. Write a statement calculates the total working hours of each employee by using the SUM() function with the GROUP
BY clause, as shown in the following query:
 mysql> SELECT emp_id, emp_name, occupation, SUM(working_hours) AS "Total working hours" FROM
employees GROUP BY occupation;
11. Execute the following statement that calculates the working hours of all employees, grouping them based on their
occupation and returns the result whose Total_working_hours>24.
 mysql> SELECT emp_id, emp_name, occupation, SUM(working_hours) Total_working_hours FROM
employees GROUP BY occupation HAVING SUM(working_hours)>24;
12. Execute the following query that removes the duplicate records in the working_hours column of the employee table
and then calculates the sum:
 mysql> SELECT emp_name, occupation,2. SUM(DISTINCT working_hours) Total_working_hours FROM
employees GROUP BY occupation
